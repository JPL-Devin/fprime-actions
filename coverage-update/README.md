# nasa/fprime-actions/coverage-update

Composite action that generates per-module + global gcovr coverage on a
**push** event (or `workflow_dispatch`) and writes the results to a
per-base-branch orphan branch named `<baseline-branch-prefix>/<ref-name>`
(e.g. `coverage/devel`, `coverage/release/v4.2.0`, `coverage/v4.2.0`).

This action does **not** comment on pull requests. Pair it with
[`coverage-check`](../coverage-check/) for the PR side.

## Prerequisites

The caller must have already generated and built the UT cache. Use
`run-unit-tests` with `run-check: 'false'` before calling this action:

```yaml
- uses: nasa/fprime-actions/run-unit-tests@devel
  with:
    run-check: 'false'
    jobs: random
- uses: nasa/fprime-actions/coverage-update@devel
```

gcovr is provided by `fprime-tools`'s pip dependencies (via the `setup`
action).

## Required permissions

```yaml
permissions:
  contents: write
```

`contents: write` is needed to push commits to the baseline branch.

## What it does

1. Calls [`coverage-common`](../coverage-common/) to discover modules and
   generate global + per-module coverage.
2. Resolves the baseline branch as `<baseline-branch-prefix>/<ref-name>`
   from `github.ref_name` (tags use their tag name verbatim).
3. Fetches or creates the baseline branch as a worktree (orphan branch on
   first push).
4. Mirrors the per-module + global outputs into the worktree, writes
   placeholder pages for modules with no coverage, generates the top-level
   checklist `index.html` (with platinum/gold/silver/bronze badges) and a
   machine-readable `catalog.json` (schema v2).  The checklist merges
   whatever other artifact types (e.g. [`codeql-publish`](../codeql-publish/))
   already exist on the branch.
5. Commits and pushes via the shared retrying publish helper
   (`coverage-common/scripts/publish_baseline.sh`); non-fast-forward pushes
   are retried after re-mirroring, so concurrent writers to the same branch
   cannot clobber each other.

Forks are skipped automatically (no push from forks).

When multiple workflows publish to the same baseline branch (coverage,
codeql, future int-coverage), give each publisher job the same repo-wide
concurrency group:

```yaml
concurrency:
  group: baseline-publish-${{ github.ref }}
  cancel-in-progress: false
```

## Inputs

| Input                    | Default      | Description                                                                                          |
|--------------------------|--------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `working-directory`      | `.`          | Directory to run `fprime-util` from.                                                                  |
| `target-platform`        | `""`         | Target platform/toolchain passed to `fprime-util`.                                                    |
| `jobs`                   | `""`         | Parallel job count for check. `random` picks 1-32; empty omits `-j`.                                  |
| `baseline-branch-prefix` | `coverage`   | Prefix applied to `<ref-name>` to form the baseline branch (`<prefix>/<ref-name>`).                  |
| `coverage-subdirectory`  | `coverage`   | Subdirectory inside each module's baseline-branch entry. Set to `""` to flatten the shadow folder.   |
| `tier-platinum`          | `95`         | Line-coverage percent required for the platinum badge tier.                                            |
| `tier-gold`              | `90`         | Line-coverage percent required for the gold badge tier.                                                |
| `tier-silver`            | `80`         | Line-coverage percent for silver; below is bronze. No coverage is bronze.                              |

## Outputs

| Output            | Description                                                       |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `catalog-path`    | Absolute path to the generated `catalog.json`.                    |
| `baseline-branch` | Name of the baseline branch written (e.g. `coverage/devel`).      |

## Baseline branch layout (default `coverage-subdirectory: "coverage"`)

```
<prefix>/<ref-name>            (orphan branch, e.g. coverage/devel)
├── catalog.json                       machine-readable module list (schema v2)
├── index.html                         checklist landing page (badges per module)
├── coverage/                          global --all run
│   ├── summary.json
│   ├── coverage-all.html              gcovr's native global report
│   └── coverage.*.html                gcovr per-source detail siblings
├── Svc/CmdDispatcher/coverage/
│   ├── summary.json
│   ├── index.html                     was coverage.html
│   └── coverage.*.html
├── Drv/LinuxGpio/coverage/
│   └── index.html                     placeholder: "no coverage recorded"
└── ...                                one entry per discovered module
```

With `coverage-subdirectory: ""` the per-module artifacts land directly
in the module's directory (no shadow folder); the global run still lives
in a top-level `coverage/` because that's where gcovr writes it.

## `catalog.json` schema

See [`coverage-common/README.md`](../coverage-common/README.md) and
`scripts/catalog.py`.

## Usage

```yaml
name: "Coverage"
on:
  push:
    branches: [devel, release/**]
    tags:     ['v*']
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  coverage-update:
    runs-on: ubuntu-22.04
    permissions:
      contents: write
    timeout-minutes: 90
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with: { fetch-depth: 0, submodules: true }
      - uses: nasa/fprime-actions/setup@devel
      - uses: nasa/fprime-actions/run-unit-tests@devel
        with: { run-check: 'false', jobs: random }
      - uses: nasa/fprime-actions/coverage-update@devel
```

## Bootstrapping

The first time the workflow runs against a new branch or tag, the
baseline branch does not yet exist. This action creates it on demand
(as an orphan branch).

To seed manually before opening any PRs, run the workflow via
`workflow_dispatch` on the base branch (e.g. `devel`).
