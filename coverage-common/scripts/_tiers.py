"""Badge-tier computation shared by the catalog and CodeQL scripts.

Tiers (best to worst): platinum, gold, silver, bronze.

Coverage tiers are driven by line-coverage percent -- the same metric the
delta detector (``compare.py``) uses for its regression gate -- against
configurable thresholds.  Modules with no coverage data are bronze.

CodeQL tiers are driven by the worst finding severity:
    * no findings          -> platinum (gold is also "no findings"; the
                              distinction is reserved for future criteria,
                              so today a clean module earns platinum)
    * worst is low/note    -> silver
    * worst is medium or
      error/high/critical  -> bronze
